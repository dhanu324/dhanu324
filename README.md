## Professional Summary

I am an engineering student who enjoys working close to the core of software systems — logic, data handling, and structured problem solving.  
My learning approach is project-driven, where understanding fundamentals matters more than shortcuts or surface-level features.

I am comfortable working independently as well as in collaborative environments.
